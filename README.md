# PromptMotion

PromptMotion is a powerful tool that generates smooth, cinematic animations based on script-based descriptions. The generated animations are composed of frames that bring your story to life, capturing emotional moments with characters and scenes. PromptMotion is perfect for creating animated videos from custom-written scripts, bringing art and stories together seamlessly.

## Features

- **Script-based Animation**: Provide a script describing your scenes, and PromptMotion will generate corresponding visuals for each scene.
- **Character Memory**: Characters are recognized and remembered across scenes, ensuring consistency in visual representation.
- **Customization**: Customize prompts and scene descriptions to tailor the animation style.
- **Seamless Transitions**: The generated animations flow smoothly from one scene to the next, capturing the essence of cinematic storytelling.
