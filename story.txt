Page 1: Moonlit Forest Temple
Panel 1: Liora, a young woman with flowing silver hair down to her waist, emerald green eyes, and wearing a midnight blue cloak adorned with silver embroidery, stands before an ancient stone temple covered in glowing blue runes. "The Starfall Temple, just as grandfather's map indicated."
Panel 2: Close-up of Liora's determined face illuminated by the blue glow of the temple runes, her emerald eyes reflecting the magical light, silver locks framing her delicate features. "The celestial alignment happens only once every century."
Panel 3: Wide shot of the forest surrounding the temple, massive ancient trees with twisted trunks reaching toward the starry night sky, their leaves shimmering with bioluminescent blue spores, stone pathways half-covered in moss leading to the temple entrance.
