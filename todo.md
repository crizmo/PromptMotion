Parallel Processing:
Generate images in parallel to speed up the process. Use a library like async or Promise.all to handle concurrent image generation.
Script Parsing Improvements:

Enhance the script parsing logic to handle more complex scripts, including dialogue, actions, and scene transitions. Consider using a more sophisticated parsing library or writing a custom parser.
Prompt Generation Enhancements:

Improve the prompt generation logic to create more detailed and context-aware prompts. Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to better understand the script and generate more accurate prompts.
